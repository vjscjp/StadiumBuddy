# Stadium Buddy
Demo application showing CMX at a stadium.

This is a dummy application (HTML and JavaScript with fixed data) showing how CMX might be used by a user at a football stadium.  The application shows a map of the stadium with the user's location indicated by a black dot and the words "Your Location".  The user can right click on the dot or its caption to show a context menu with selections for nearest food service, nearest rest rooms, or nearest gate.  Selecting an item shows the requested data, with green, yellow, or red dots showing the crowds at each location.  Hovering the mouse over the location shows its description.
